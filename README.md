### Community
Discuss BQT on 
- the BlenderArtists [thread](https://blenderartists.org/t/bqt-custom-ui-for-add-ons-tool-in-blender-with-pyqt-or-pyside/1458808)
- [Ynput  thread](https://community.ynput.io/t/use-bqt-for-blender-qt-integration/127)

### Alternatives
- Custom (non qt) Blender UI: https://github.com/mmmrqs/bl_ui_widgets
- Blender native UI (N-Panel etc.) [tutorial1](https://b3d.interplanety.org/en/creating-custom-ui-panels-in-blender/) [tutorial2](https://medium.com/geekculture/creating-a-custom-panel-with-blenders-python-api-b9602d890663) 
- Cookie cutter, need to find the link. Some blender devs made a more low level custom UI solution for Blender. Seen at blendcon 22, was a bit buggy though.
