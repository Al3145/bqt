Thank you for your interest in contributing to bqt's documentation! To get started, read the [[README]]. The following process may look complex, but we've broken each step down into bite-sized pieces. Don't be afraid to make mistakes - you can't break the project if you're not admin.

### Prerequisites
Before you start your first contribution, install the following tools:
 - Git
 - A Git client, like [Fork](https://git-fork.com/) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
 - [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
If you are new to using Git and GitHub, please read [about Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git).

## Your first contribution
The following steps are geared toward complete beginners. If you get lost or stuck, please feel free to ask questions [in this thread](https://github.com/techartorg/bqt/issues/92) or troubleshoot with Google search. Let's go!¬†üö∂:  
#### Fork the repository

2. Click **Fork** in the upper right corner.
3. Uncheck the "**Copy the master branch only**" option and click **Create fork**.

#### Clone the forked repository
Click the **< > Code** button above your forked repository. Under the Clone tab, choose the option that works best for your machine and Git client. Refer to [cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository?tool=desktop)for additional help.

#### Open the repository with your Git client
1. Access your cloned bqt repository with your chosen Git client.

The wiki files are formatted using [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

#### Make your first edit
Once you have chosen a wiki file in Obsidian, make a minor edit to the text. For example, you can change the capitalization of a letter or add punctuation.
