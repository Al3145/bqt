## Getting started
Read the [[README]] first. This will sound complex, and like a lot, but if you try step by step and google when you get stuck, or ask questions [here](https://github.com/techartorg/bqt/issues/92), you'll get there. Don't be afraid of making a mistake, you can't break the project if you're not admin.

### What you'll need


## Your first contribution
Here we goÂ ðŸš¶:  
1. Fork the repo with all branches.
2. Clone the forked repo (big green button at the top on the front page).
3. Swap branch to the wiki branch.
4. Open the folder in obsidian, and edit the text files (make a test change to anything).
5. Make a single edit, push it to your fork.
6. Create a Pull Request.
Once you successfully created a PR, feel free to close it. You are now ready to make real PRs.

For your next steps, make actual changes to the docs.
Then repeat the above steps to push the changes, and create a PR.
Review it with a maintainer, maybe implement their feedback, and iterate on it until it get's merged in.

## Next steps
Check out the [issues](https://github.com/techartorg/bqt/issues) with the  `documentation` tag.
