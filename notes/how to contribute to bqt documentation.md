Read the [[README]] first. This will sound complex, and like a lot, but if you try step by step and google when you get stuck, or ask questions [here](https://github.com/techartorg/bqt/issues/92), you'll get there. Don't be afraid of making a mistake, you can't break the project if you're not admin.
